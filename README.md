## About

This is an open collection of 3D designs of projects, hobby creations ands comercial things.

> Also available on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/rapax00).

### Why free and open?

I believe that the best way to learn and grow is by sharing and receiving knowledge.

> All designs in this repository are licensed under the MIT License unless a LICENSE file is included inside a Thing folder.

### Mision

To share and collaborate with the 3D maker community to create better things.

### Vision

FOST concept: Free and Open Source Things.

To create a large collection of 3D designs for free use and collaboration.

### Software stack

> All software used are FOSS.

- FreeCAD: For 3D modeling.
- PrusaSlicer: For slicing.
- Inkscape: For 2D design.
